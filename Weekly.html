    <h1> ~~~~~~~Scoville Heat Scale~~~~~~~~~~</h1>
    <p> The scoville scale was named after Wilbur Scoville who used to give human subjects hot chilis to measure their spice levels. Now the amount of scoville heat units in peppers can be measured by counting the particles of capsacin in the peppers themselves. Capsacin is the substance that causes a spicy reaction in people. Contradictory to popular belief, seeds do not contain capsacin the surround tissue near the seeds, the placenta, contains the highest concentration of capcasin.   </p>

    <figure class='box'>About Chef Shuff</figure>
    <p> "Chef" Matt Shuff is not really a Chef, but a lover of cooking and food particularly of the spicy variety. Living in Austin Texas, he often creates strange fermented concocotions of fruit, hot peppers, and vinegar to light up his mouth in the best way. His goal is to sell a line of hot sauces, marinades, and condiments to liven up pallets all over the world. At Chef Shuff's, we strive to use the best and locally sourced ingredients possible. He even uses peppers from his backyard garden in his sauces when they are available.
